# NASM REPL

A x86-64 assembly REPL for Linux. [NASM](https://nasm.us/) is used to assemble instructions, and [ptrace](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html) is used to write and execute them in a child process.

## Features

Type an instruction to execute it. Any register that has changed will be printed.

```
> mov rax, 0xff
rax            0xff                255
```

Changes to the stack memory will also be printed. Changed bytes are colored in red, and the position of rsp is colored in blue (not visible here):

```
> mov byte [rsp-1], 0xff

```

It's possible to call functions in the C standard library:

```
> mov rax, "hello"
> push rax
> mov rdi, rsp
> call puts
```

It's even possible to call functions in your own libraries by using LD_PRELOAD:

```
$ cat foo.c
int square(int num) {
    return num * num;
}
$ gcc -c -fpic foo.c
$ gcc -shared -o libfoo.so foo.o
$ LD_PRELOAD=./libfoo.so ./nasm_repl
> mov rdi, 4
> call square
```

## Commands

Type a register name to print its value:

```
> rax
rax            0xff                255
```

To print all registers, use the `regs` command:

```
> regs
rax            0x0                 0
rbx            0x0                 0

rdx            0x0                 0
rsi            0x0                 0

```

To print the stack memory, use the `stack` command:

```
> stack
